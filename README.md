# Personal_Diary_WebApp

My Personal_Diary_WebApp is a thought/idea of keeping memories on this webapp which allows you to write, store and view your ideas/thoughts and memories.

A place to store your content of diary live and safe.

My attempt at making a decent interactive diary.

**Note**:- This WebApp is only for laptop users. We are trying to make this fesible for Android users also.
